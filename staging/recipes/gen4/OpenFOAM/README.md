## OPENFOAM
[OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org/) (for "Open-source Field Operation And Manipulation") is a powerful and popular open-source C++ software toolkit for the simulation of fluid flow, heat transfer and other related physical phenomena. It is an object-oriented, open-source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) toolbox with a range of solvers for different physics, such as incompressible, compressible and turbulent flows, multi-phase flows, solid-fluid coupling, electro-magnetic, and chemical reaction. It is used for modelling and simulation of a wide range of engineering applications, from aerospace and automotive to marine and biomedical.
